# DDC Automatic Brightness - C/GTK 3.0 Implementation

A native C/GTK 3.0 application for controlling monitor brightness using ddccontrol with automatic scheduling based on time of day.

## Features

- **Native Performance**: C implementation with minimal resource usage
- **Proper Package Management**: Can be packaged as .deb/.rpm for easy install/uninstall
- **Monitor Detection**: Automatically detects DDC/CI compatible monitors
- **Brightness Control**: Real-time brightness adjustment with slider
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Progressive brightness adjustment throughout the day
- **Configurable Schedule**: Add/remove custom time points and brightness levels
- **Desktop Integration**: Proper .desktop file and system integration

## Building

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev ddccontrol

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc gtk3-devel glib2-devel ddccontrol

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel gtk3 glib2 ddccontrol
```

### Compile

```bash
cd src/
make check-deps  # Verify dependencies
make             # Build the application
```

### Install

```bash
# System-wide installation
sudo make install

# Create .deb package (Debian/Ubuntu)
make package
sudo dpkg -i ddc-automatic-brightness-gtk_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# If installed with make install
sudo make uninstall

# If installed with package manager
sudo apt remove ddc-automatic-brightness-gtk  # Debian/Ubuntu
```

## Usage

### Launch
```bash
# Direct execution
./ddc-automatic-brightness-gtk

# From application menu (after install)
# Look for "DDC Automatic Brightness (GTK)" in Utilities
```

### Basic Controls
1. **Monitor Selection**: Choose your monitor from the dropdown
2. **Brightness Adjustment**: Use the slider to set brightness
3. **Automatic Mode**: Enable checkbox for scheduled brightness
4. **Schedule Configuration**: Click "Configure Schedule" to set times/brightness levels

### Configuration
Settings are stored in `~/.config/ddc_automatic_brightness.conf` using GLib's KeyFile format.

## Advantages over Python Version

### 1. **Proper Package Management**
- **Complete Removal**: Package managers track all files for clean uninstall
- **Dependency Handling**: System packages manage library dependencies
- **System Integration**: Native desktop and menu integration

### 2. **Performance & Resources**
- **Fast Startup**: No interpreter overhead
- **Low Memory**: Minimal runtime footprint
- **System Libraries**: Uses existing GTK/GLib libraries

### 3. **Distribution Integration**
- **Repository Inclusion**: Can be included in Linux distribution repositories
- **Consistent Look**: Uses system GTK theme automatically
- **Standard Behavior**: Follows Linux desktop conventions

### 4. **Upstream Contribution Potential**
- **Same Language**: Written in C like ddccontrol
- **Familiar Patterns**: Uses similar GTK patterns as gddccontrol
- **Easy Integration**: Could potentially be merged into ddccontrol project

## Development

### File Structure
```
src/
├── main.c              # Application entry point and main UI
├── brightness_control.c # Monitor communication and control
├── monitor_detect.c    # Monitor discovery and detection  
├── config.c           # Configuration file management
├── scheduler.c        # Brightness scheduling logic
├── schedule_dialog.c  # Schedule configuration dialog
└── *.h               # Header files
```

### Key Components
- **Monitor Interface**: Wraps ddccontrol commands for brightness control
- **GTK+ UI**: Native GTK widgets following Linux desktop guidelines
- **GLib Configuration**: Uses GKeyFile for cross-desktop config format
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for easy maintenance and testing

### Contributing
This implementation follows ddccontrol project patterns and could potentially be contributed back to the upstream project as an enhanced GUI with automatic brightness features.

## Comparison with Python Version

| Feature | C/GTK Version | Python Version |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Installation** | Package manager | Manual file copying |
| **Uninstallation** | Complete removal | Manual cleanup |
| **Dependencies** | System libraries | Python + packages |
| **Performance** | Native speed | Interpreted |
| **Memory Usage** | ~5-10MB | ~20-30MB |
| **Startup Time** | Instant | 1-2 seconds |
| **Integration** | Full desktop | Limited |
| **Contribution** | Upstream potential | Separate project |
