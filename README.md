# DDC Automatic Brightness

An application for controlling monitor brightness using ddccontrol with automatic scheduling and system tray support.

## Features

‚úÖ **Smart Monitor Detection**: Automatic DDC/CI monitor discovery  
‚úÖ **Hardware Auto-Detection**: Real-time detection of newly connected monitors via udev (when available)  
‚úÖ **Enhanced Tray Integration**: Full tray support with brightness controls and schedule preview  
‚úÖ **Schedule Transparency**: Tray menu shows current scheduled brightness even when auto-brightness is disabled  
‚úÖ **Brightness Control**: Real-time brightness adjustment with slider  
‚úÖ **Automatic Scheduling**: Progressive brightness adjustment throughout the day  
‚úÖ **Startup Options**: Run minimized to tray, --help, --tray modes  

## Recent Improvements

üîå **Hardware Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects newly connected monitors in real-time using udev events (when libudev-dev is installed). Just plug in your monitor and it appears instantly!

üëÅÔ∏è **Schedule Transparency**: The tray menu now shows "Auto Brightness: 70%" displaying what brightness would be applied if auto-brightness were enabled, updating every minute throughout the day.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (Required)
sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev ddccontrol

# Ubuntu/Debian (Optional - for hardware auto-detection)
sudo apt install libudev-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc gtk3-devel glib2-devel libayatana-appindicator-gtk3-devel ddccontrol libudev-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel gtk3 glib2 libayatana-appindicator ddccontrol systemd-libs
```

### Build and Install

```bash
cd src/
make check-deps  # Verify all dependencies
make             # Build the application

# Install system-wide
sudo make install

# Or create package for distribution
make package
sudo dpkg -i ddc-automatic-brightness-gtk_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

### Quick Test

Go to the folder src/.
After making changes run "make".

```bash
# Test compilation
./ddc-automatic-brightness-gtk --help

# Run with tray support
./ddc-automatic-brightness-gtk --tray
```

## Usage

### Command Line Options

```bash
./ddc-automatic-brightness-gtk [options]

Options:
  --tray, --minimized  Start minimized to system tray
  --no-gui             Run in background (tray only)
  --help, -h           Show help
```

### GUI Controls

1. **Monitor Selection**: Choose your monitor from dropdown (auto-refreshes when new hardware detected)
2. **Brightness Slider**: Real-time brightness control (click to jump to position)
3. **Auto Brightness**: Enable/disable scheduled brightness changes
4. **Configure Schedule**: Set custom time/brightness points
5. **Startup Options**: "Start minimized to system tray" checkbox

### System Tray Features

- **Smart Status Indicator**: Shows "X" when no monitors found, brightness percentage when available
- **Schedule Preview**: "Auto Brightness: 70%" shows current scheduled brightness (updates every minute)
- **Hardware Detection**: Automatically detects newly connected monitors and retries detection
- **Brightness Quick-Select**: 20%, 25%, 35%, 50%, 70%, 100% options

### Configuration

Settings stored in `~/.config/ddc_automatic_brightness.conf`:
- Monitor selection preferences
- Per-monitor auto brightness settings  
- Custom brightness schedules
- Startup options

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.c              # GTK application + tray integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ brightness_control.c # Monitor DDC/CI communication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitor_detect.c    # Monitor discovery via ddccontrol

### Dependencies

- **GTK 3.0**: Modern GUI framework
- **GLib 2.0**: Core utilities and configuration
- **libayatana-appindicator3**: System tray support
- **ddccontrol**: Monitor communication
- **libudev** (optional): Hardware auto-detection for newly connected monitors

## Development

### Building

```bash
make clean && make  # Clean build
make debug          # Debug version with symbols
make test           # Basic functionality tests
```

### Package Creation

```bash
make package        # Creates .deb package
make install        # System-wide installation
make uninstall      # Complete removal
```

### Contributing

This implementation uses patterns consistent with the ddccontrol project and could potentially be contributed upstream as an enhanced GUI with automatic brightness features.

## Troubleshooting

### No Tray Icon
```bash
# Install tray support
sudo apt install libayatana-appindicator3-dev

# Check if tray is detected
make check-deps
```

### No Monitors Detected

The app now uses intelligent retry logic - it will automatically retry detection at 30s, 90s, and 180s after startup. You'll see an "X" in the tray icon when no monitors are found.

```bash
# Test ddccontrol directly
sudo ddccontrol -p

# Check permissions
sudo usermod -a -G i2c $USER
# Log out and back in

# For immediate detection, click "Refresh Monitors" in the GUI
```

### Hardware Auto-Detection Not Working
```bash
# Install udev development headers
sudo apt install libudev-dev

# Rebuild with hardware detection support
make clean && make

# Check if hardware detection is enabled
make check-deps
```

### Compilation Errors
```bash
# Verify all dependencies
make check-deps

# Check Ubuntu/Debian packages
sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev
```
